Implicit integer upgrading for variables:
* Never cast signed to unsigned or vice-versa
* The smaller integer is upgraded to the larger one

Implicit integer upgrading for var and literal:
* The literal is extended or truncated to match the var size
* The literal value has its signed-ness changed to match the var
* If the value of the literal cannot fit into the desiered type, error

Implicit integer upgrading for literals:
* The smaller literal is upgraded to the size of the larger literal
* The signed-ness of the smaller literal is changed to that of the larger literal
* If changing the signed-ness would cause the value to change, error

General Notes:
* Pointers cannot be implicitly casted to ints or vice-versa
* Pointers cannot be implicitly casted to pointers of different base types
* Pointers cannot be implicitly casted to pointers of different counts
